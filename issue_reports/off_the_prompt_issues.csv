To: Respected Programme Director of National University of Ireland Galway

Dear Sir or Madam,

As my current work is focusing on improvement in the company that has already been running for years, for my future Master’s Degree program, I intend to focus studying on how to help Start-up companies or Small and Medium Enterprises, that have just run their businesses either with their owned capital or with investment from foreign countries, allocate their capital effectively and efficiently. I am strongly inspired by people around me who have just built their businesses but have to close their ventures due to financial problems, especially in this pandemic. Therefore, I am highly passionate to study finance more deeply because it has core importance in today’s most dynamic and emergent world. At the same time, I would like to take part in realizing one of the sustainable development goals of the United Nations about decent work and economic growth that aim to encourage the formalization and growth of Small and Medium Enterprises, including through access to financial services. I would like to start from my motherland, Indonesia, as one of the emerging market economies that has been received lots of investment. 

I choose the National University of Ireland Galway (NUI Galway) because it is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) Exemption Accreditation, and affiliated with the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts (CFA). Moreover, the core modules offered include ‘Advanced Corporate Finance’ that will strengthen my skills in applying a range of corporate finance tools and techniques to assist in making valuation, financial and strategic decisions under conditions of uncertainty, for instance in this pandemic situation. Upon gaining a Master’s Degree, I plan to work in the Ministry of Investment, to implement what I have learnt for economic growth in Indonesia.",140,2016,-0.0019151568412780762

What measures can be taken to protect them?,645,"Homework provided by teachers and lecturers is a vital factor in developing children's essential skills. However, most people hold the view that teachers should not give homework to children and while others believe that homework is a crucial factor that plays a huge role in children’s education. I agree with the latter view of the argument and the reasons for this will be elaborated on in the subsequent paragraphs will examples. 

To commence with, it is true that assessing homework for children daily will make children exhausted in education because today most teachers are putting a huge pressure on subject material taught in the school time period as a repercussion offsprings come home tired. Thus, providing extra assignments or thesis for children will lead to serious consequences of children not being able to socialize with family members or friends.  As an example, 35% of children refuse to go to school and learn, and they tend to drop out of school at an early age. Thus, youngsters should be given free time to relax their minds after school. 

On the other hand, I believe that juveniles should be given homework because today most schools are not teaching according to the given time period and some children are not paying attention in classrooms. As an example, if it is the school sports day many children from the classroom go for sports practice thus they neglect their subject materials. Teachers providing a number of homework materials for children will not only enhance their knowledge but will refresh their skills in what was taught in class. 

To conclude, although there are negative effects of providing children homework such as they do not have free time, but engaging youngsters in homework will allow them to enhance their skills in education and knowledge.",203,1799,-0.014460159465670586

With the introduction of Caucasian Cristian element to the court Heurum during the reign of Tahmasib I,Caucasian slaves emerged major ethnic forces of the Safavid empire. Moreover, during the reign of Shah Abbas I, the Christian population and Jewish community of the Safavid empire behaved with the high respect and tolerance. There was no religious persecution during the reign of Shah Abbas I.  Western primary sources implies that the construction of churches commenced in this period.  

2. What major events and processes changed the history of Azerbaijan in the 18 centuries?

In the beginning of the 18th century, there was started the political, economic, and political decline of Muslim empires. This period was also called as “Global 18th century”. There was a deep political and socio-economical crisis in Safavid empire. Afterwards, the Afsharid state was established by NadirShah in 1736. He was the potent ruler of Turkic and Islamic world. Furthermore, the lost territories of the Safavid empire was returned during the reign of Nadir Shah I. Unfortunately, after his assassination in 1747, Azerbaijan divided into several khanates. 

3. Explain Azerbaijani Khanates making and breaking alliances policy 

The constant conflict and internal struggle prevented unification of Azerbaijan. The rise and strengthening of regional powers led to the end of khanates’ dream to unify and create a holistic Azerbaijan. Despite the attempt to unify Azerbaijan, khanates remained separate. Therefore, tribalism and lack of unification was predominant features of the khanates. Neighboring with Russian and Qajar empire was the one of the disadvantages of khanates.",113,1751,-0.09421983361244202

To begin with, cold water on the surface of the earth is pumped down to the injection well which is at the depth of 4.5 km. At this point, water is heated by hot rocks in geothermal zone so that cold water becomes hot one and it will be contained in the production well. The next step is that hot water is pumped up to the surface of the globe and is ready for condensing.

The following step is that condensed water is changed to be stream which is the power activating a turbine. After that, this active turbine generates the power to start electric generator.

While the efficiency of these new products may not always be absolute, this essay contends that they generally prove more effective than older counterparts, a trend driven by both consumer preferences and societal benefits.

To begin, consumers inherently gravitate towards new products, believing them to offer superior results compared to outdated alternatives. For instance, the recent launch of Versace's Sunscreen in January 2024 exemplifies this trend. Marketed as not only harmless but also capable of protecting the skin against harmful sun emissions, this product likely incorporates the latest advancements in technology and production methods.

Moreover, the relentless pursuit of innovation by businesses deserves commendation, particularly when aimed at societal advancement rather than solely economic gains. Pharmaceutical companies worldwide are actively exploring new methods to develop more effective treatments for debilitating illnesses like cancer and osteoporosis. The commitment of these companies to leveraging innovation for enhanced efficiency in treating various ailments is both admirable and beneficial to society.

Why might this be the case.
What could be the disadvantages of being self-employed.
These days an overwhelming majority of people choose to run their own business rather than being employed by other business. I am of the opinion that strong desire to be wealthy and also regular business seminars encourage people to start their own business. However, they may face some difficulties in future.
There some prominent reasons why people choose to run their own business. Firstly, in many modern societies entrepreneurship is greatly encouraged by a large number of business seminars and workshops advertisements. These seminars and workshops not only provide individuals with any information which they need to set up their own business ,but also people are being told that they have no limit and can easily become as wealthy as a Steve Jobs is. Moreover, individuals particularly those who are willing to be a business person and live in luxury are convinced that start their own business.
On the other hand, there are some drawbacks associated with self-employment. The first issue that self-employed may face is the necessity of being a jack of all trades specially if the company is very small and they have not enough money . They have to be an accountant, human resource manager and so forth at the same time. It is because they are not able to hire other people to do these tasks. Furthermore, they had to pay tax and provide their employees with decent working condition. Moreover, due to the fact that companies these days are facing fierce competition, many of them are not able to pay their own bills and debt and go bankrupt.
