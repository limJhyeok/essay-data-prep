153,the increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. what are the causes of this? what can be done to solve this problem?,153,"He increase in the production of consumer good results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem? Nowadays, as most consumerconsumer goods are manufactured, more damage has been inflicted to the environment. I will outline several reasons for this and put forward some measures to this issue.

First of all, the increase in the production of consumer products harms the environment in two ways: the chemical by-products from the manufacturing process and the mass production of disposable goods. As more goods are produced, more toxic wastes and emissions are released from factories into nature. Water sources are contaminated, and the air is severely polluted, which results in the deaths of many marine and terrestrial animals. Also, to accommodate customers’ ever-increasing demand, more single-use products are introduced, most of which are non-biodegradable. Though having a short lifespan, these products can remain as wastes for thousands of years, turning our planet into a huge landfill and posing a threat to the living habitats of all creatures.

Actions must be taken as soon as possible to minimize the negative impacts on environment arising from the increasing amount of consumer goods. First, companies should promote the use of eco-friendlier materials. For example, the giant coffee chain Starbucks has recently replaced plastic straws with reusable alternatives made of materials like paper or bamboo. In addition, many governments are also encouraging the development of more sustainable manufacturing processes. For instance, many states in the U.S offer tax breaks and incentives for businesses using renewable energy, and some firms are even allowed to purchase green energy at cheaper prices than traditional fossil fuels.

In conclusion, there are two main reasons why the environment is severely impacted by the increase in production of consumer goods. To address this issue, governments and companies must join hands to make the production lines more environmentally friendly by switching to greener materials.",163,2103,0.6993865030674846,the increase in the production of consumer,42

Tackling this issue is challenging, especially given the speed of social change and the pressure of modern life. Therefore, this essay will explicate some key reasons why environment is polluted and will suggest a range of possible measures that can be taken to improve/change the situation and highlight probable knock-on effects of polluted environment. 

A wide range of reasons can be put forward to elaborate why the environmental pollution caused by produce consumer goods. Perhaps, one can definitely assert that lot of companies did not treat the drainage properly. The industrial waste of a monosodium glutamate factory called Ajinomoto can be taken as an example. To demonstrate, because the modern drainage was not installed by this company, and they threw all the industrial waste into the water causing water pollution in this area. Thus, it is no surprise to see that there is rise in producing consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment.

Improvements to polluted environment can be achieved in a variety of ways, strict management of dischargement is one of the most favourable and note-worthy choice. To elaborate, government should be controlled strictly and only allow which company to have environmental protection standards so they never can throw their trash which are harmful to the environment into the atmosphere. This can improve the situation by controlling the amount of industrial waste to environment and encouraging recycle waste. Thus, while there can be other steps to be taken, this can be considered to be a good start towards declining the damage to the natural environment caused by manufacturing consumer goods.",163,1865,0.5521472392638037,increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment.,90

       In general, there are a lot of transforms in citizens ' lives. We may have more crimes and cue-side all over the town. Firstly , all world people has a different life and properties than other. This could affect poor people for having water, food, cloth, education and more other important essentials. Secondly, there will be more homeless for example in the USA some youth just live in there own car, in the reason, they do not have enough money to buy the house, however, they just buy the car and ran out of money. So they just go anywhere they like, sleep in there car and do not have any home. While, poor people cannot do anything because there changes just for rich people and there will be more poor people than past.

      On the other hand, some people think the opposite. They think that they might afford their own money. The reason is that there can be a bad financial conditions in the country. People in that country should be satisfied about any changes by the government or any additional increase for the economiceconomis wealth. Citizens think that there country is alreadycountry already rich, so any additional increase just be the leftover for them.

      Overall, a lot of changes are being right now and the changed about the social level of rich and poor will be more clear than ever.",226,1466,0.5619469026548672,"experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens",122

To what extent do you agree or disagree?

In this contemporary epoch, whilst proponents hold the view that rich countries cannot make their citizens pleased easily and they are not in a nice position, I am of the belief that the public feels pleased with any increase in their country as they have their right in equally way. My convention will be explained. 

On the one hand, despite disagreeing that people do not get satisfied as they have everything, some advocates believe that any growth in salaries or other life materials helps families to live better. This means that when parents get an increase in their salary, they can buy things that they could not afford  earlier. For example, when Brazil planted some beans which returned to  coffee and that made them richer than before and it helped their citizens significantly. Hence, what can be said is that any increase in the means of living, even in a small way,  affects positively  life.

Nevertheless, opponents and I are convinced that any rise in the country can transform families' lives as some big countries have poor people. In other words, when Governments get extra money to spend on institutions like hospitals, parks and schools, they are creating finer life. To illustrate, Switzerland is one of the richest in the world but this did not make its individuals less satisfied with any increase in  salaries as life has become so expensive. Hence, developed peoples know the importance of development and money, and that is what keeps them at the forefront.

In conclusion, after this essay has manifested the abovementioned points, it can be reiterated that even though some individuals do not feel satisfied with anything, other people already do. Therefore, I am convinced that there anyone feels happy with any the increase.",188,1947,1.0,"experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied.",142
621,"some people believe that they should be able to keep all the money they earn, and should not have to pay tax to the state. to what extent do you agree or disagree?",621,"Some people believe that they should be able to keep all the money they earn, and should not have to pay tax to the state.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?

There are people living in different countries who often asks themselves 'Why should we give decent part of our salary to the state?'. It could be no clear why taxes are existing but nevertheless they are important for the functioning of the whole nation of each particular country.
I think that taxes are a necessary part of our life and without them we could end up in a very bad situation.

Some may say 'If we had this money we would be better at managing them than the government!'
But I think it is not true for most of them. Quite a few people in the world have appropriate education for creating and managing long-term plans when we talk about money. Also, when we pay the tax we supporting not only our future, but also the life of the other people too.

In my opinion the main reason why we should pay taxes is a availability of public services. For example, public transport, education, medicine etc. All these things can't exist without taking part of a income people of the country. Of course to have all these things working properly government has to do its job at good level.

In conclusion, I believe that taxes are important part of the modern world. Without it, any big city couldn't exist today.

757,some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. what is your opinion? give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.,757,"Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.

It is true that when people advance into their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.

To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.

In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.

In contrast, the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries. Since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise, in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly. The early signs of this have been seen in many countries that were forced to raise the retirement age, including my home country where men can now retire at the age of 67 instead of 65. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable.

In conclusion, the provision of state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen the concern of retirees to some extent. However, considering the issue of sustainability of this provision, it is better to opt for individual savings from the very beginning of working life, for the benefit of both individual and national development.",309,2651,1.0,people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire.,114

Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth rather than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.

To What extent do you agree or disagree?

In modern era, prominent personalties are well-known for their materialistic possession and style more than their accomplishment, mijority of masses apperhend that this influences the socitey and youth negatively.I strongly agree with the statament as the young generation of our conutry get distracted and try to amuliate their behivour in real life. 

To commence with, youngesters deviated from their path as they follow the emient people and see them as their role model since most of the famous persons are not well-educated that result,student to think education is not important to be successful. No wonder this trend has devastating impact on their career as education is powerful weapon to change the world. for instance, karshima kapoor is one of the recognised actrees of bollywood with 10th passed qualification.Mostly she is notable for her personal life and fashion rather than, her talent this may change the perception to become populor. 

Secondly the youth are not enough mature to understand it required a lot of hard work and dedication to move ahead towords glory which can not be attainable over a night. Moreover, they admire celeb fasinating lifestyle, bank balance and fame. Therefore they get distracted easily specially in the world of internet where infromation spread like a flash.

On the one hand, it is not effective for students to study new method.Firstly, there are two kinds of students: lazy and hard-working.

However, educating adults who cannot write or read is even more important and governments should spend more money on this.

In my opinion, I strongly disagree with this statement. And the following example will be provided in order to support my point of view.

One of the most important reasons why  Education of young people is highly prioritized in many countries. However, educating adults who cannot write or read is even more important and governments should spend more money on this is that Children are the future  workers in each country since Children must grow up and find a job for their income. This situation will make the economy of the country progress. For example, according to the latest research conducted by Bangkok University, it was revealed that 80% of the student in Thailand  10 years ago become a worker who must spend money for their daily life, therefore, the economy in Thailand in all aspects at  the present was increased. This example shows that age plays a major role in the economy.

Another reason to support this is the fact that older persons can not do a benefit  the country.

This is due to the fact that within twenty years, most adults will become  elderly people and they must use the budget from the government. To illustrate this , in recent news, it has been reported that 

Most of the older people  in Canada can not do  work at the company and were retired from their organization. Moreover, they only stay at home and wait for the budget of about 3000 dollars per month. Consequently, it is not worth investing in adults who will be  elderly people in the future.

This case makes  an invention clear.

In conclusion, it is undoubtedly true that the Education of young people is highly prioritized in many countries. However, educating adults who cannot write or read is even more important and governments should spend more money on this because Children are the future  workers in each country and older people can not do a benefit  the country.",230,2069,0.7956521739130434,educating adults who cannot write or read is even more important and governments should spend more money on this.,113

Do you think the advantages of this technology outweigh the disadvantages?

In this day and age, the developments of technology on social media give a pool of opportunities for individuals to communicate with each other easily and get information about the changes worldwide.Its advantages overlap more than disadvantages and I firmly agree with this topic by stating my perspectives.

It is considerably convenient to socialize and take news involving the changes in the local areas and the world.  To be more specific , it is reasonably cheap and affordable for individuals  to talk to their family members,relatives and friends on social apps such as Telegram,Instagram and Facebook wherever they are or whenever they want. Furthermore,  modern technologies are considered crucial factors in sharing and accepting the news also the chance to become an online member of international events such as festivals, concerts etc for just a monthly fee.For instance, somebody who is in a different place from being concert can access virtually due to a pen pal for participants attending the concert .

However, there are several disadvantages that social apps may useless tools for humans. Browsing on telegram for some social purposes can cause children to become addicted the social networks.As a result, their study rate may decrease in a sensible way.

(media),2420,"It is a common belief that many people use social media every day to get in touch with other people and obtain the news. However, there is a more persuasive argument that using social media too much can make people depressed and affected by fake news.

      On the one hand, Social media can help people relax with news and call their friends. It is a happy time for users. Citizens can join social media so easily. They just need a smartphone or  computer with the internet . After that, people can create an account and talk or chat with anyone if they want. In their free time, people always read news free on social media but do not need to pay money for newspapers. For instance, in my university, students are really busy, so in their break times, they usually join social media or read news on smartphones like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook,... and get a lot of information about showbiz, worldwide, nature… From that point, they can get much knowledge of mankind and that is good for their future.

     Nevertheless, people use social media too much because they have neurological problems. They are increasingly closed and shy to talk with others. Some criminals can use social media to steal information and money from users. The government can not control the content on the Internet because that is private to citizens, so a lot of fake news is not  good for users. For example, research has shown that sixty per cent of teenagers are affected by toxic information on the Internet and fake news. Furthermore, the toxic news and bad friends on the Internet make them against their parents and teachers. 

    To sum up,  there are some disadvantages to using social media in life.

The disadvantage of this development is that  using social media to contact work or people will reduce the chance to meet each other since population can talk together , even though, we stay so far. For example, I slept in my bedroom and I just woke up then I was hungry. Consequently, i can use social media to tell my mom to cook by not necessary meeting her in the kitchen.

Despite this, there are significant advantages it can bring to people's lives. Firstly, Using an app network can decrease the waste of time to meet face to face. This is because we can talk by using the internet For example, according to the latest survey conducted by Bangkok University, it was revealed that many people stayed in Canada and  miss their parents in Thailand ,  They can use a video call to see  their faces.

Healthy lifestyle is paramount to leading a long and happy life. Some believe that governments should shoulder the responsibility for its citizens health. While others believe, it is should be an individual choice. It's a very commendable if an individual is able to make right choices in the matters of his/her well-being. However, the problem stems from the fact that many people fail to make right decisions pertaining to their health.

Evidently, putting the responsibility of healthiness in the hands of people, clearly doesn't have a good success rate. In today's world, diseases like obesity, diabetes and cancer has become global epidemics. The majority of these illnesses are attributed to abysmal eating habits and lack of physical exercise. And there is overwhelming an amount of research out there that could support these claims. However, if governments take the responsibility of the healthiness of its citizens, it has better chances of combating these diseases. The reason being, governments can easily get access to the best research available out there to combat these conditions. Also, it has the best doctors and research facilities at its disposal, which makes it easier for them to come up with the solutions to eradicate these diseases.But

But, there are also quite a number of people who advocate that the decision of lifestyle should solely rest with the individuals. They claim that the excessive indulgence of state in the lives of people might come off as controlling. And nobody appreciates being constantly told what to eat and how much to exercise. In fact, there is a chance people would do the exact opposite as a form of protest towards the authority.

In conclusion, the state that strives for the welfare of its citizens is more likely to build a strong country. At the same time it should refrain from being excessively invasive on the health related decisions of its people. No matter how much effort the government puts in, at the end of the day every citizen should possess his own individual accountability. We as responsible individuals, should put our own sincere endeavours in leading a sickness free life.",287,2440,1.0,"people think that the government should ensure the healthy lifestyle of people, but others argue that it should be decided by individuals.",138

It is argued that the best way to reduce poverty in developing countries is by providing at least six years of free education for each child, so that all children can read, write and use numbers. I firmly agree with this assertion because education can solve unemployment problems which responsibly leads to the poverty effects.

The first reason to consider is that the best way to develop countries is to develop people. In other words, a country with a large number of high-profile schooling persons can avoid facing the poverty issue than others. For example, many governments from developed nations in the world have strong strategies for education. In the USA, there are many scholarships for easily obtaining knowledge.

An additional reason point is that reading, writing, and mathematics are the basic skills for individuals to obtain employment. This means that the sponsorships from their nations in early education directly figure this topic out. To exemplify, citizens with fundamental working skills can access employment salaries and then they can take this income to look after their families. Furthermore, people who graduate from a minimum of six years of teaching can extend their profile by attending universities.

All things considered, I am of the opinion that supporting citizens with the fundamental six years of tuition can decrease poverty in countries. Therefore, the government and individuals should carefully realize a balance between providing free education and encouraging people to find jobs by themselves.",322,1610,0.5093167701863354,"the best way to reduce poverty in developing countries is by providing at least six years of free education for each child, so that all children can read, write and use",168

Therefore, some people think that newspapers are the best way to get news. However, others believe that they can get news better through other media platforms.

First and for most, newspapers are suitable for most senior citizens. Because they have a habit of reading a newspaper every day. And it is difficult for them to change a habit. Moreover, newspapers are a more reliable source of information than those of media platforms. Newspapers are written by professional journalists and they have to be checked, edited carefully before the reaching the reading public. 

However, media platforms is also the convenient way to approach to the new information. With the widespread of the internet, readers can receive the information faster. They only have portable devices such as smartphones, laptops and so on. It is easy to access a huge storage of news in just a few clicks.

What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?

Traffic congestion has been a major problem in many urban communities of the world. As high number of traffic tie-up is increasing on daily basis thereby causing problem which many believes over population and bad roads with inability to read traffic signs to be the reasons for this. However, reduction in number of populace and construction of good roads with education on usage of traffic signs could help curb this challenge. The following paragraphs will expatiate more on my views.

To begin with, road block in many cities and towns is as a result of large population. Individuals from near and far chose a particular city as their place of abode thereby increasing its population count. As a result of this, there is road blockage during rush hours in those cities. For instance, the former capital territory of Nigeria, Lagos state is vastly populated due to its lucrative and affluence value, therefore leading to jam during a specific time frame such as in the morning and evening. In addition, bad roads has caused more harm than good. This has led to death of so many citizens. Also, nonchalant attitude of masses in the usage of traffic signs increases grid lock in many society. 

Furthermore, road blockage can be eradicated by construction of good roads and educating the illiterate drivers how to interpret the traffic lights. As this helps to reduce delay in traffic and death witnessed as a result of it. For example, traffic signaler or flag person should be placed in each traffic post , in order for them to assist in the movement and coordination of vehicles. Subsequently, people in authority shout perform census in order to reduce the number of immigrants in a city as these helps to reduce over population. 

In conclusion, although increased number of populaces and damaged reads has been sited to be the cause of traffic lock in many cities, construction of good roads and reducing population count will go a long way in assisting with the problem.

Others think parents needn’t do that as children can read books or watch TV, movies by themselves. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

There is an opinion that parents do not need to tell children stories or read books because they can do it on their own, in contrast to this position there is a belief that this is part of the upbringing of children. I think that children should always read fairy tales or tell them stories because children need care. 

On the one hand, parents believe that the child should be independent, so they do not consider it necessary to read the child stories. They believe that children should choose what to read or watch without the help of their parents. Therefore, such an attitude of parents is a form of caring for the child and worrying about his future. Recent studies in psychology show that children who since childhood, become independent in the future adapt more quickly to adult life.

On the other hand, many parents are convinced that reading books to children is part of their child's upbringing, and in raising children, the essential tool is attention. By spending time with children, they develop their human qualities of empathy and attention to close people. If they ignore children, they may become callous and rude and unable to empathize. There is a lot of evidence that children remember very well the fairy tales of childhood that they were sung or told by their parents, and this trace remains with children throughout their lives and helps them overcome the difficulties of our lives. I believe that the essential quality of a person is kindness and paying attention to children makes this world kinder.

On the one hand, traditional teaching is more effectiveness of students. It ensures that students must attend the lesson to learn knowledge. Teachers ask a question during the lesson which is students need to  answer immediately and without checking in online. It confirms that the learning progress of students. For instance, students are able to find the teacher after the lesson when they facing the difficulties. Teachers can solve the problems instantly. Thus, traditional teaching is no longer result in unnecessary waste of time.

On the other hand, classic teaching covers the ways of life. A school is a small zoom out of society. In a school, teachers do not just give subject knowledges to students and also teach the children study communicate with each others. students learn how to socialize, making new friends and emotional aspect to possibly respond in the future. For example, school stage is very important of children which is develop a communication skill to avoid the children be autistic. A educator may find the children has problem and solve the problem in the early phrase. Thus, classic teaching is help children to develop social skills.

I totally agree with this statement as I think it will raise the sense of community and also increase health quality for the community.

On the one hand, people can benefit from clean and peaceful public outdoor places like a park. Firstly, trees in the park will provide clean and fresh oxygen. For example, it is true that many people go running in the morning at the park to benefit from the environment there. Furthermore, the park can help increase the health quality of the community. For example, my mom takes a park as a typical place to go running every morning just because she likes the atmosphere there. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that a public place like a park has many advantages.

Having a healthy routine plays a vital role in order to achieve success. Citizens fitness should be prioritized by the states.

I agree with this statement that more and more funds should be sanctioned creating awareness which is extremely important. This essay will throw some light on the same.  

To begin with, in today's fast-paced work-culture, well-being has been higly undermined due to cut-throat competition across the globe.

Moreover, a better way of living not only help an individual in success but also make a person more positive towards the desired goal.  For instance, generally, an unhealthy person mood fluctuates a lot, which leaves a negative impact on his performance. Thus, health-oriented approach, as well as knowledge, is really important. 

Another primary reason is, in recent time, a big section of population eats junk food which again leads to a disproportionate diet. Due to this youngsters are facing many ailments like obesity, high blood and heart diseases. Some experts have already been alarmed that upcoming generations may face severe  problems as compared to previous ones.

I mostly agree to this statement. In this essay, I will describe the idea that every school teachs the same thing, how that benefit their student or not and are there any school that do differently?

First of all, In every school, they teach general academic subjects such as Math, Science, English and etc. In addition to these subjects, there are lessons intented to make the students become responsible citizens of the society. For example, social studies or law studies that teach students what they should and should not do. And that they will recieve punishment if they do something wrong. Also, when students spending their time in schools, they will learn how to behave and interact with each other. School disciplinary is also the way to guide children to the good path.

Furthermore, because every school have the same standard for the graduated students. Their curriculums tend to be the same. And that has a negative effect on the student. Because everyone has his own talent. Teaching students the same thing doesn't mean that thay will get equal score. To illustrate, when someone who's good at drawing and someone who's good at Math study Algebra together, he who excels at Math will do better. But, does this mean that students who get bad grades are bad student? No, they may be bad at Math but they have something they good at too. Unfortunately that their capabilities have to be measured with an only same standard.

However, some schools may not be like the others. There are a few schools whose intent are not just to bring up their student to be good people but encourage them to be the best version of themself. These schools still have the same requirement for their students to meet. but they support things that are not in the requirement too. To give examples, some schools permit students to join clubs of their interests after studying periods, such as, art club, music club and sports club. Furthermore, these schools curriculum may not limit to just science course and social studies course. They have other course like literature, management and art course too.

To sum it up, every school have similar ways of teaching and preparing their students to become good citizens and workers of the societies. Yet, they teach the same things to every students , despite the fact that everyone is unique and has his own way of learning. Therefore, you could say that this way of teaching doesn't benefit their students individually. That's why i agree with this statement. However, there might be some schools that do it differently.

Some individuals argue that the major intention of schools is to make off springs into good citizens and laborers while others claim that it is beneficial for children. In my opinion, I partially agree with this statement, and my reason will be elaborated on in the forthcoming paragraphs.

 

To begin with, most of the subjects that are taught in schools aim to teach us how to be appropriate national for the government.  Moreover, sometimes these courses are not really advantages for pupils since they are not really interested in that subject, However, they should pass these lessons which will teach them about acting politely, which leads to kind and respectful folks. As an example, social studies will aim to help us become well-behaved residents of society in the future.

 

On the other hand, the duration of time that juveniles spend attending school is equivalent to the work hours of worker individuals. Indeed, they both spend most of their golden time putting effort into tasks that they are disinterested in and at the end of the day, they are just too exhausted to find their actual talent. For instance, in some nations, some jobs are not considered as real careers such as being an artist and at times, families do not allow their child to follow their dreams and force them to be an ordinary human with a normal life and work from 9 to 5 like other human beings.

Firstly, school will give their learnes about khowledges and skills to meet their job requirements so that they could get job easier. For instance, people who are fresh gradutes could be apply for jobs which has job descriptions same as their khowledges sector at universities, so  they have more chance to be accepted by the company. If they get the jobs, they will have ability to afford their cost of living, then pay taxes for social. Therefore, this make it clear that they are people who take more benifits.

Secondly, school will give their learnes khowledges to develop the mental health on themselve. For example, kids will be taught ethical lession to become a better children in their families. Moreover, kids also learn survial skills that extremely essential in their life such as swimming, cooking..etc.Thus, it becomes appearant that learnes get more valueable from school than social.

Some people have comments about the treatment of young people. They express that young people and youngsters who commit crimes and break the regulations should be treated in the same way as adults who commit crimes. In the forthcoming paragraphs, I shall explain my thoughts in detail and extend my opinion about this issue in our society.

To begin with, in my opinion, prevention is better than cure, so if the government make various policies and regulations against crimes and criminals, finally some people who want to commit crimes will be declined. Therefore, first of all, strong rules will improve the level of social safety. In addition, I disagree with this theory that young people who commit crimes should be treated in the same way as adults who commit crimes, because they have a clean soul rather than adults, and they can change their future by improving their good abilities. For example, if a young boy commits a theft, he can change this bad personality to a good personality.

Additionally, in  developed and developing countries such as the United States of America and European countries, their governments have established special prisons for young people apart from adults who commit crimes. In the long run, they can manage young people's misbehaviours and treat them.

In conclusion, it seems that young people who commit crimes should be treated in  different ways as adults who commit crimes, and the governments should provide new facilities to improve the bad habitats of young people in the long term.",134,1802,0.5895522388059702,young people who commit crimes should be treated in the same way as adults who commit,85

Some people think that leaders are born with leadership qualities, but opposing this, some think leadership qualities can be achieved. A leader with leadership qualities, in my opinion, should have a good and strong personality, while the essential skills for leadership can be achieved.

To be a born leader requires natural skills and qualities through which he/she can encourage, motivate, and inspire people with lots of energy. Some people are born leaders. Leadership qualities can be found in singers, motivational speakers, and business managers who can manage and arrange big and crowdy events and inspire others with their knowledge, management, presentation, and personality,

Like nowadays, a lot of leadership and mentorship training, workshops, and seminars are arranged by different institutions and people learn leadership, management qualities, learn new skills, improve their personality and communication skills, and improve their knowledge and confidence. Different politicians learn leadership qualities from experience to rule and prove that leadership can be achieved by practice and experience.

Leadership is an action not a position. The matter of fact is that the practical meaning of leadership is far   different from theoretical world. The bookish language will assist you for sure but to be a great leader, a  person should hold two qualities courage and persistence along with hard work and that leads him to   enormous victories.  In my opinion if a person has this god gifted quality and yet does not utilize his true potential in terms of   leadership that means he runs his own life by himself and on the other hand if a person aims to change he   will ;indeed.  ‘’Man cannot remake himself without suffering for he is both the marble and the sculpture’’  There is an example of leadership qualities of Nelson Mandela who always think for the next generation, never focus election. He always motivate his nation, and picked his nation from the darkness to bright   future, he always talked about rule of law and never broke any law.  And for those who think that leadership qualities can built actually they were talking about politicians and   politicians always show-off their activities just act like leaders but they are not leaders and they not have   leadership qualities, they always focused just on the next election to make people fool. The best example  of such type people of is Nawaz Sharif from Pakistan.  That applies to the fact that if you are desperate enough to attain heights of success then for sure you will   attain. This then ends the contradiction that leadership is a quality people are naturally born with, with   dedication anyone can learn the art of leadership, coming to the conclusion of my essay.  Leadership always born naturally the their qualities are GOD-GEFITED but peoples can also learn a lot Good Qualities as leaders have, with the passage of time.",151,2169,0.9867549668874173,believe that people are naturally born leaders while others feel that leadership skills can develop.,100

Whereas some individuals believe that video games are devastating for children's improvement,the opponents are of the notion  that it is beneficial for them.Although in my point of view,its positive footprints surpass in multitudes aspects,different sides are uttered here.

  One of the most highlighted advantages has to do with its impression on users' knowledge.To enlighten,not only enhances it juveniles capability in utilising technology as the current affair but their lingual information would be fortified while they have to interact with others with divergent tongues from different nations.Consequently,both the awareness of technology usage and similarly knowing various languages would be beneficial for their subsequent personal and social lives, grasping a job vacancy for example.Furthermore,the youngster will be saved from the hazards that are awaiting them in  society.As a vivid case,neither kidnappers nor drug sellers have the capacity to abuse them if they are entertained with their computers at home.

On the other hand,various diseases may they encounter owing to the sedentary lifestyle that these smart boxes bestow to folks.To illustrate,Either:the risk of obesity or eyesight problems has swelled among people,who spent the majority of their time in front of screens.To explain,due to research,humans' eyes are sensitive to the light of screens.Moreover,ignoring the activities that used to be more conventional,like cycling,can have some detrimental effects on the mental and the physical realms.as a fact,the balance of body hormones stems from people's function during their lives,which would not be set properly if individuals deprive themselves of physical activities.Therefore,an inappropriate development may occur in their brain and muscles.

To conclude,while some undeniable drawbacks would be experienced by the young,who are attracted by computer games,namely:visual problems or obesity,to me its affirmative sides,such as enhancing adolescents' knowledge about other languages and as well technology utilization, outweigh drastically.Nevertheless,its related side effects could be eradicated by restricting the hour of playing game by children",195,2392,1.0,say that playing computer games can have positive effects on the way children develop.,86

A group favours multiple programs primarily because of the range it offers. With increased number, the variety of genre is available which interest individuals. Often, the liking for anything differs from person to person, so everyone can benefit with type of shows they like. To illustrate, Zee TV, a famous Indian entertainment channel, maintained highest TRP for consecutive 5 years as the shows involved categories like crime, food, movies and songs.

On the contrary, there are people who think the value of programs decline if they are in bulk. Foremost, in order to provide multiple shows, there is a compulsion on TV producers. Consequently they come up with any type of show which might not be appealing but just for the sake. For example, currently, people prefer to watch TV only on specific time for a particular show which they like as they do not find every program interesting.

Some people reckon that it is an extravagant waste of time to beef knowledge up, instead of this they would rather boost interior confidence and quarrel with their mentors. While their contestants suppose it would be a reduction of respect and submission among students. I believe that  teachers must not diminish the quality of education, but solidifying and inspiring also should be intruded into the educational system

To start, preachers don't have the right to keep information from students , they have to teach them knowledge as well. For example, if the child is confident but not clever enough he or she will  never pass entrance exams or make further decisions. Secondly, another reason is self-esteem does not give them superb predicaments to broaden their horizon of knowledge. Thirdly, in spite of the fact that studying sometimes might be  monotonous pupils are not eligible to cease doing hard work in order to create their desirous luxurious life in the future.

To reflect the fact that a lack of self-confidence combined with an impeccable brain might not satisfy the competent's demands of an employer or in  life as a whole. For example, the learner who hesitates would  rather not show their capabilities fully and properly. Firstly, loss of certainty in humans might turn them into grey mice who are scared to endeavour new things and steps. Secondly, individuals who don't dread  something and had a great formation at  school time could transcend all barriers. Finally, in general,durability unified with the ability to exhibit in front of the public or outpour feelings will lead to unbelievable results

Some people opine that students should be supported to evaluate or criticize teachers, while others are worried that these acts would lead to a chaotic classroom. I personally side with the former view because the two-way communications helps instructors refine their teaching methods and enables students to become more involved in the lessons.

To begin with, educational standards can be raised because teachers can modify their ways of delivering lessons based on the students' feedbacks. For example, if the class is slow, it will be ineffective for teachers teach too fast so that most students would fall to retain the information. Therefore, based on the comments of students, lectures would find it is easier to know the appropriate speed of the lesson and adjust themselves to their audience. This would result in enhanced pedagogical methods of teachers.

Furthermore, i believe giving the students the freedom in expressing their thoughts and feelings would enable them to become more proactive. For instance, many countries are promoting students-centred teaching with two-way communication, where open discussions between tutor and trainee are encouraged. This approach has a clear advantage of making students become more involved in studying. Increased participation in the classroom activities helps pupils understand and memorize lessons faster, which eventually improves the educational outcomes.

In conclusion, I believe allowing students to make judgement on teachers would result in better pedagogical methods of the educator and increase engagement of pupils in lessons. Consequently, i prefer the opinion that this measure should be encouraged to enhance educational quality despite the risks of disrespect and indicipline.",156,2057,1.0,"people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students should be encouraged to question and offer criticism of their teachers.",151

People have different views about whether allowing students to evaluate or criticize their teachers. While some argue that this two-way communication in the class could result in disrespect and indiscipline, I believe that this approach could make an improvement in the quality of education systems.

On the one hand, there are several reasons why it can be argued that students who are given permission to assess the teachers could lead to the lack of respect and discipline in the classroom. Firstly, as young students are immature, impulsive and inexperienced, they could easily give negative words to teachers when it comes to controversial issues. For instance, students could give a wrong answer for a Math exercise, but insist that they are right, and this lack of knowledge could make them lose tempered and criticize their teachers. Secondly, the class may be in chaos due to massive numbers of comments. Opinions can vary from students to students, and it is impossible for teachers to find out the best way that satisfies all the students.

On the other hand, I believe that giving students the freedom in expressing their thoughts and feelings to teachers could enhance the quality of education. Perhaps the principal reason is that this interaction could boost students’ critical thinking and particularly ensure the level of comprehension. For example, the teachers may teach too fast that students are not able to understand; in this case, thanks to learners’ responses, teachers could adjust their speeds and methods so that students could fully retain the knowledge. Another reason is that this approach could improve teachers’ pedagogical skills. Teachers who do not carefully prepare the content of lessons may provide wrong information, and feedbacks of students could help them find out their mistakes.

In conclusion, I would contend that encouraging students to judge their teachers could lead to increased educational quality despite the possibility of disrespectful and undisciplined attitudes among students",250,2293,1.0,"people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students are encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers.",148

Carelessness while driving can lead to severe accidents. Therefore, the only way to improve the safety of our roads is to give much stricter punishments for driving offences. According to my perspective, I completely agree with administering severe penance for any kind of recklessness or irresponsibility on the streets as any mistake can cause someone to lose his or her life. In the essay, I will discuss the reason that lead to accidents and why severe penalizing is necessary for such delinquency.

 Firstly, punctuality is a major reason for mishaps on the highways. To put it more simply, people speed on the highways and break traffic rules when they are getting late to reach their destination.

Tackling this issue is challenging, especially given the speed of social change and the pressure of modern life. This essay will express complete agreement with this view and will justify this viewpoint.
A wide range of reasons can be put forward to elaborate why driving offenses should be punished strictly. Perhaps, one can definitely assert that citizen become more and more aware when they participate in traffic. Confiscation of driver's license can be taken as an example. To demonstrate, because this takes people a lot of time to retest and get the license again, loosing license can make people be more careful when driving or riding. Thus, it is no surprise to see that the rise in drive unsafe has been linked to many in traffic accidents and much more people get severely injured.
 Additionally, it is also hard to dispute that penalties for dangerous drivers help prevent them committing the same offence. Namely, the most compelling evidence is bringing to the court. In detail, violating serious offences in Germany can subsequently lead to the people be brought the court, which can be favorable in road safety.  As a result, sterner penalizes on driving offenses can be considered to be beneficial because it potentially impacts on raising awareness which then changing the driving behavior more safety.

6094,"experts believe that over the next decade, robots will be doing many of the jobs currently done by humans. discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this.",6094,"It is indisputable that the advent of technology, especially robots, plays an vital role in modern life. Authorities say that it is possible that artifical intelligence could take over human tasks in the coming decade. Despite this replacement seems to be a good idea, it also has its drawbacks. I am going to give my opinions below.

It is appearent that the birth of robots has great contrtibutions to financial plans of governments. In the field of manufacturing, robots could potentially reduce labour costs in the long run, as they do not require salaries, benefits, or other ongoing expenses associated with human employees. Although there are maintanance costs, they can be offset by increased productivity and reduced human workforce requirements. Addition to this, the product quality would be under control thanks to robots. They could consistently perform tasks with high precision and accuracy during manufacturing processes. Moreover, artifical intelligence entities could minimize errors, reduce variability, and enhance product consistency, resulting in higher-quality products. In the future, I believe, robots will have more significant contributions to other aspects of society. 

On the other hand, the appearence of robots does have its negative influences on employees. One of the major concern is that the widespread use of robots may lead to considerable job losses for humans. They take over tasks previously performed by humans, as a result, unemployment rates may rise, causing socio-economic challenges and income inequality. Despite advancements in robotics, there are still limitations and risks to consider. Robots may encounter difficulties when facing complex, unpredictable situations which require adaptability, flexibility and decision-making. 

In conclusion, it is important to notice that the impact of robots on the job market and society is a complex and multifaceted issue.

But I extremely disagree about it, in fact, there are some jobs that require human skills, some that  artificial intelligence wouldn’t have.

People are afraid of being replaced in their jobs by machines, but they don’t think further about the problem, it wouldn’t work with some jobs that require the employee to talk with the customer. For example, having a conversation with a customer in a restaurant about describing the plate that they are about to eat, could probably engage the client to order it,  ,nevertheless robots could also do the job of a chef, but they won’t have the feeling of hospitality that a person could give.

  Robots are rising nowadays; it might be true that some robots will replace human jobs in the future. But in my opinion, some jobs cannot be replaced by robots. In this article, I will discuss why some manual work cannot be replaced by machines.

  In my opinion, some jobs cannot be taken the place of androids. Because they require human skills like creativity, subjective judgement and so forth. For example, a childcare expert. A childcare expert is a job which provides children with the education and training they need. But robots cannot treat children or babies like humans because they do not have an imagination or the ability to own assessment. Human communication is the need for infants to learn and grow. Therefore, mechanoids may not think like human beings and cannot replace human beings.

  On the other hand, robots will not take over humans. Since humankind prefers to talk with mankind. For instance, when we go to the shopping centre, and want to ask something we don’t know or don’t understand, we will go to the information desk and ask for help. We will expect to talk with a human, not a golem. Many people thought that human–to–human conversations are much more meaningful and more comfortable than talking with a android. Consequently, androids will not take over humans.

  Overall, I think robots are hard to come after human beings’ jobs now and even future. Robots will make our life simpler and more convenient, but it doesn't have many human beings like feeling.",113,1622,0.5309734513274337,people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by,55

Although there are many reasons why people should attend individual sports, I personally think that team sports are more advantageous.

On the one hand, individual sports have several merits. First, people will have opportunities to develop their skills. When a person participates in an individual sport, they can develop their soft skills such as stress management, emotion control, confidence and self-esteem. This is mainly because individuals will have to develop a strong mindset to deal with and overcome any obstacles by themselves/ on their own. Second, individual sports give participants better chances to push themselves. This means that they have to establish goals and create new personal records. For example, when swimming, people can set up the goal they want to achieve and do it themselves without friends or teammates. 

On the other hand, it is my firm belief that playing team sport is a better choice . To begin with, people will improve their teamwork skills. The chance to improve interpersonal abilities, such as cooperation and communication, will aid people in their workplace as well as in their daily social connections. For instance, football players not only play a game but also make strong connections with each other since they learn how to trust and understand each other. Moreover, when people play team sports, they can have a great chance to meet new people. They not only meet their teammates but also players from other teams that they compete with. As a result, individuals can expand their network, which is very advantageous to their career.

It is worth acknowledging that more and more people are becoming have the hobby to find out about the history of the house or building they live in.And why the interested in this ,in my view ,i think it is a way to show  their love about the house they live in.Many people are also live in a old town now,especially for the elderly people .I trust they love their hometown very much.The history in their house or building is also their childhood ,so more and more elderly people interested in finding their childhood.They can find many kinds of things,such as the stamps ,the coins and so on.

There must have some reasons based on current developments, and thanks to current developments they could make it much easier to research.

The first reason  why more and more people are getting interested in searching for their houses' history is that with the rapid social development, people have a strong need to know what happened in their living places. As  society develops, more and more people left their hometowns and go to big cities to find  better opportunities for careers. This kind of migratory may make people  have a feeling of unsettled. Additionally, the houses they live in do not belong to most of them which mean they know nothing about what happened before, and this feeling of the unknown could raise their curiosity to find out what happened exactly. Knowing the story of houses could offer a strong feeling of settlement and safety.

Another reason is that  many houses are built a very long time ago, even over a century. With a century's stay, those houses definitely have some historical issues inside. For example, many tenants like to leave something behind for the next tenant, and those meaningful objects could remain something special on that. At the same time, knowing the history of houses could offer a feeling like having a conversation with predecessors which is really amazing.

How can people research  history could be easily done. On the one hand, they could search for archives in the local libraries or archives centres where they could offer the most official information. On the other hand, they could take advantage of the internet, appealing to those who know the story and have an offline meeting to tell them.

In the following paragraph, I will explain the reason and how to research this.

   The primary reason why some people nowadays have the tendency to look for a house or building history is that they want to understand the structure. Some people are simply fascinated by the original architecture or the design of the place they are living in. Old buildings that still stand will usually have some interesting history about them. The fact that they survived so long is itself a sign that those buildings were important at the time of their construction. Maybe they were occupied by royal or aristocratic families. Finding out such details can be interesting for many people. For some people, researching the history of the building could be an attempt to avoid staying in a haunted place or something like that. If the building has a haunted past, people can choose not to live in them.

  There are various ways people can find this information. The simplest method is that people can ask local citizens for information, especially the elders. Because they are the people who lived in that neighbourhood for a long time,  they will be a worthwhile source of information if anyone wants to understand more about their houses or their living areas. Another way is to search for information on the Internet or through other modes such as books or historic articles. For instance, Paris's old town has many buildings changed into museums and learning spaces.

On top of that, there is a quote ' Old but Gold' this means no matter what new things are becoming popular but can not compare to  antiques. For instance, Bagan has been existing for many years ago and we can know the skill of the people of the city by seeing the architecture. For this reason, the culture and traditions of Bagan are really great  and unique at that time. Thus, this is announced as one of the UNESCO places in the world.  Archaeologists, historicism and engineer are always visiting  historical places and buildings to gain  knowledge .On the plus side, these are very effective and useful to apply in our living lifestyle.

Some people think that it is too late to do anything. Some people think that we should take effective action to improve the situation. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.

Some people argue that it is not necessary to stop human’s wrongdoings to the environment as it is too late, while many people believe that some measures should be taken to tackle environmental issues. This essay explains both sides of the argument and explains why I believe we should have solutions to mitigate the negative consequences to enhance the environment.

There are two main reasons why many people think it is too late to join hands to protect the environment. First, due to the proliferation of technology as well as many other fields in the world, the majority of people believe there will be experts or conservationists to solve environmental problems. It is solely because people regard these issues are not relatable to their life because handling environmental problems is too overwhelming to their duties as citizens. Second, the poor awareness of some people about the environment has led to this wrong assumption. These people have not been educated properly about the environment and after observing the detrimental destruction of the environment, they think that it is nothing humans can do anymore.

Above the above argument, I support the view that we should handle environmental problems immediately. One of the reasons is that it is never too late to conserve the environment. There are a variety of solutions to conserve the environment available for everyone to do, such as planting trees or reducing vehicles’ fumes. Environment plays a vital role in contributing to humans’ health; therefore, conserving the world is a method to ensure people remain healthy. There are many respiratory diseases and illnesses caused by the detrimental environment that many people have to suffer.

Discuss both sides and give your opinion.

Recently, there has been a discussion about whether the art subject is necessary for school children or not. Although many people oppose the suggestion of having art as one of the subjects at school also, many people support this.  However, in my opinion, like other subjects art subject is also important for the students to learn. This essay will examine both sides of the views in the following paragraphs.

To begin with, many people believe that studying art subject help the students to learn about the vast heritage and culture of the nation they belong. To put it in other words, many people strongly agree that, nowadays children are lacking  morals because of the unawareness of cultural values so, learning art subjects at school is necessary to alleviate this issue. For example, juvenile crimes are inclining because of the mentioned reason and this had been proved by the study conducted by Punjab University in India in 2018. 

On the contrary, few others completely believe that learning other subjects like science and maths will be more useful for the children in the future. This is because of advancements in technology and  people blindly think that  only technically skilled graduates will be getting better paying job opportunities. Due to this mentality, people reckon that studying art subjects are unnecessary for school children. 

In a nutshell,  people should realize the importance of learning art subjects and how these subjects offer a positive impact on student's behaviour in future.

on the one hand , it is true that increasing the cost of fuels and all vehicles has some advantages .firstly , it can reduce car fumes if government increase the cost of fuels and all vehicles , because a few people can afford to pay the cost of fuels to drive their cars to go to work .secondly  it is beneficial for the environment,because fewer people drive cars fewer fumes can be produced,therefore it can solve pollution problems .finally, it good for people healthy ,and reduce the number of  people who  suffer from the breathing problems.

on the other hand , increasing the cost of fuels and all vehicles has some advantages , but I think increasing the cost of fuels and all vehicles also may cause some disadvantages.firstly ,it increases the financial burden on relevant industries, especially for the transport industries ,because the company cost more than before , then it may  also develop the price of products ,so that few people want to buy them,and customers decrease the demand for products,then company can make fewer profits which cause the decrease of the staff's salary,moreover,it increases poverty.secondly, it is inconvenient, because it can put pressure on public resources,for instance,  public transportation also becomes more and more crowded ,increasing the number of  workers taking buses and subways.

Some folks believe that one of the best solution to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuels for cars and other vehicles.Because higher fuels prices increased people’s spanding on cars and other vehicles so people will reduce the frequency of using cars.Tail gas include carbon monoxide ,sulfur dioxide and other gases harmful to environment ,it can cause air pollution and green house effect or acid rain.So increase the price of fules can help to protect the environment.

However,I deem that way can not solve the problems from the root.Because environment pollution problem is a complex problem,it can divided into air pollution,land pollution and water pollution.Vihicles and car tail gas just occupied a small proportion. If it can be solved ,environment problem can not be solve absolutely because water and land pollution.In addition,if the cost of fuels increased,there will be some rich folks use the cars as usual.So I consider that the better solution is that goverment should encourage bicycle companies to dispense a certain amount of free cycling cards to citizen,this can attract some people to choose this environmental  frendily to commute.

There are a lot arguments to support my statement. Firstly environmental problems are caused different causes, combustion of fossil fules are one of those reasons. We should concentrate on each and every aspect to controll the environmental cahanges. We must stop deforestration, dumping chemicals into rivers, excessive use of water resourses etc..., all these acts causes environmental changes like global warmig. As some people's point of we must stop using fossil fuels, at least try to use less, but increasing cost of fuel is not a solution.
Our whole economical system depends on fules now a days, so increasing prices of the fuels will causes more chaos in the society. Instead we should create awerness on fossil fuels in the society to reduce the usage of the fuels. Industries, governments must concentrate on other alternatives of fossil fuels.

Some individuals argue that the major intention of schools is to make off springs into good citizens and laborers while others claim that it is beneficial for children. In my opinion, I partially agree with this statement, and my reason will be elaborated on in the forthcoming paragraphs.

 

To begin with, most of the subjects that are taught in schools aim to teach us how to be appropriate national for the government.  Moreover, sometimes these courses are not really advantages for pupils since they are not really interested in that subject, However, they should pass these lessons which will teach them about acting politely, which leads to kind and respectful folks. As an example, social studies will aim to help us become well-behaved residents of society in the future.

 

On the other hand, the duration of time that juveniles spend attending school is equivalent to the work hours of worker individuals. Indeed, they both spend most of their golden time putting effort into tasks that they are disinterested in and at the end of the day, they are just too exhausted to find their actual talent. For instance, in some nations, some jobs are not considered as real careers such as being an artist and at times, families do not allow their child to follow their dreams and force them to be an ordinary human with a normal life and work from 9 to 5 like other human beings.

Firstly, school will give their learnes about khowledges and skills to meet their job requirements so that they could get job easier. For instance, people who are fresh gradutes could be apply for jobs which has job descriptions same as their khowledges sector at universities, so  they have more chance to be accepted by the company. If they get the jobs, they will have ability to afford their cost of living, then pay taxes for social. Therefore, this make it clear that they are people who take more benifits.

Secondly, school will give their learnes khowledges to develop the mental health on themselve. For example, kids will be taught ethical lession to become a better children in their families. Moreover, kids also learn survial skills that extremely essential in their life such as swimming, cooking..etc.Thus, it becomes appearant that learnes get more valueable from school than social.

To what extent do you agree or disagree? 

 It is  considered that the young generations ought to contribute their leisure time to perform some Charity activities in their local society.I  agree that this  kind  of scheme would be a good idea for Juvenile groups as well as for communities.

 First and foremost, the opportunity to do voluntary community service could be carried a price of benefits for teenagers. Most paramountly, involved with these types of programs, these young people would gain valuable experience in as adult working environment,which could help to build their self confidence and enhance their skills.Another explanation is that having such work knowledge skills on their CVs could greatly improve youngers career prospects. For example, a period of unsalaried  work experience might increase  employment and promotion opportunities  and ensure a sustainable future for them.Furthermore, from these types of performance they can accomplish team collaboration capacity which can be helped in their working life to supervise and support the more junior members of staff. 

On the other hand, beyond these personal advantages the society also benefited from these  kinds of activities. Fastly,Ankit communal works accelerate society's enlargement growth and at same time   it saves money because the local government no longer needs to hire professional workers, for instance, repair roads and bridges.

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. I believe it has many advantages to offer rather than disadvantages for teenagers.

Volunteering for community service is a good practice for teenagers it helps them understand various aspects of life and aspire them to be good citizens. These kinds of services develop them emotionally and teach them to counter various difficult situations. Such services are not only beneficial to the teenagers but also helps other members of society for example volunteering in old age home not only makes them benevolent but also gives them the idea of accountability, whereas for elderly people they act as a sense of accompanying and can be the assistance of various kinds. I rather strongly feel community service is a good alternative to spending free time idle and non-productive. Social service also makes teenager self-reliant and prepare them for essential key skills required for then to grow in the society like team building, adjusting with new people and social duty.

However, there is some downside to these services especially for teenagers, since their young minds are extremely impressionable working in a community can expose them to the dark side of  society which can be difficult for them to cope. There are chances of exploitation if left unsupervised. In some cases, teenagers lose their focus on their school and studies and fall into bad company. Such all incidents can be avoided if well supervised and worked in a balanced manner.

Employees and workers are overwhelmed with a fast changing world. industry force is spending more time at task and offices to get promotion, bonuses and compensation to be successful. In the midst of a busy production schedule struggle schedule, some argue that it is damaging their personal behaviour and life relationships. Therefore, companies should reconsider their time off and working period. Furthermore, a 30-day rest from job sounds like a great idea to motivate and encourage to production hard.

To begin with, companies, industries and factories are functioning at unprecedented scale. This is because of increasing demand of industry force to meet global supply of the market. This rapid boost in the economy has forced them to endeavor non-stop and weekends as well. Such practises are harmful to individual and gets isolated from the outside world. Hence, this group are not able to spend enough time with their families and friends. 

Moreover, I support that the employer should provide a month off from effort. This will allow employees to follow their passion and take a break from endeavor. Apparently, such changes will develop a feeling of pride towards the company and will effort harder. 

On the flip side, one might argue that such huge break can redirect their motive for production. In addition, we have seen many cases of employees misusing their holiday. Such behaviour can reduce the productivity of the companies.

In summary, we can conclude that benefits of 4-week holiday outweigh the rest. In addition, punishing everyone for misbehaviour of the individual is unworthy.

This essay will provide an answer to the question of why I completely agree with this statement ?
Firstly, it is impossible to understand the complete personality of a human being via a meeting like in the areas of analytical thinking, where a meeting may only give a vague description of the participant's thinking process. However, this cannot be the only best approach but it can be one of the indicators of hiring an individual. For instance, in an interview conducted by Google, the candidates were asked to fix a physical computer after it broke down. In this case, the practical test taken by the participant to solve the problem was recorded as the analytical ability of the person and virtues like loyalty to the company and attending office regularly were gauged using an interview. Therefore, it is recommended that an interview should not be only the step while recruiting a professional but it can play a part in the entire procedure of recruitment.

Secondly, Nowadays people attend interviews with the goal of securing a job rather than providing information about their true behaviour.For example, we have seen some contestants of Miss World Competition 2017, who have declared that if they win the contest, then they would donate the prize money to the poor people of their country and after winning the prize, they chose not to donate that money. This is because the goal of participants is to win the contest rather than show their true character to the judges. So, without honesty, Interviews cannot be the right procedure to assess the suitability of an individual for a specific job.

To conclude, I strongly support the idea that interviews are not the best way to assess the suitability of a candidate for a position.

First and foremost, we can't 100% guarantee that the jailors will get the work after release from their cell since some of the owners prefer to avoid getting an employee who came from the prison due to their customer safety. In such cases, the criminal may get upset, and it would be the reason for them to make faults again.  

Secondly, the convict may need to be in a position to study as these are new for them. Some of them may be very rude to the person who is willing to teach. Educating at the cell may be a tedious task as they want to deal with the criminals. 

On the other hand, Educating the jailors would be beneficial to understand what is good and bad, which will make them to staying away from faults. And also, it would be energetic to their mental health while they were in prison.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this"". I disagree completely, because this is a very flawed statement.

Firstly, business is defined by making profits off of any commercial or professional activities; therefore, businesses cannot be represented by one singular entity but rather by a multitude of entities, each varying in their different objectives. Some lines of business might not even have any social impact or responsibilities at all. Some businesses may even seek to disrupt society for profit, intentionally worsening it. For example, the “Meth Business”, the distribution of methylamine and other addictive substances is a huge threat to young people, but technically, it still qualifies as a form of business because there are demands and profits for these products, albeit not legally.

Secondly, it is absurd to force all businesses to have social responsibilities because not all of them possess the time and money to invest in it. They have already had enough problems to worry about. For example, most of independent businesses in Vietnam are still struggling to handle their employees than bigger organizations that are meant for handling social responsibilities.

In conclusion, I believe that organizations that do have a helpful status in society should uphold their responsibility, but not all businesses are eligible for this status, and to force them to comply is utterly ridiculous",111,1517,0.8828828828828829,"well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities.",67
