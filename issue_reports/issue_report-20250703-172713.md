Okay, I will start by exploring the project structure to understand its components and how they are organized.Of course. Here is the step-by-step data issue report based on the information you provided.

# Essay Dataset Quality Assurance Report

**Summary:** This report provides an analysis of potential data quality issues identified in the essay dataset. The initial dataset contains 9833 records. Automated checks have been performed to flag several categories of problematic data, including gibberish content, duplicates, and potential scoring anomalies. The findings are detailed in the sections below.

---

### 1. Overview

The original dataset consists of **9833 essays**, each associated with a writing prompt and a corresponding band score.

*   **Shape:** `(9833, 3)`
*   **Columns:** `prompt`, `essay`, `band`
*   **Band Score Distribution:** The scores range from 3.0 to 9.0, with a mean of approximately 6.1.

Initial analysis has identified several potential data quality issues, which have been categorized and saved into separate report files for review.

### 2. Issue Breakdown

Based on the provided files in the `issue_reports/` directory, the issues can be broken down into the following categories:

#### a. Gibberish & Low-Quality Essays
*   **File:** `gibberish_issues.csv`
*   **Description:** This category includes essays that appear to be nonsensical, random characters, or repetitive noise rather than genuine attempts at writing.
*   **Detection Method:** These were likely identified using a model (`gibberish_pred`) and scoring metrics such as:
    *   `gibberish_score`: A high score (e.g., > 0.98) indicates a high probability of being gibberish.
    *   `perplexity`: A very low perplexity can indicate overly simple or repetitive text.
    *   `type_token_ratio`: A low ratio points to a lack of lexical diversity, common in repetitive noise.
*   **Example:** The sample issue with ID `268` consists of repeated, non-sensical strings, validating the detection method.

#### b. Duplicate Essays
*   **File:** `duplicate_issues.csv`
*   **Description:** This file presumably lists essays that are identical or near-identical to each other. Duplicates can skew model training and evaluation.

#### c. Prompt-Essay Similarity Issues
*   **File:** `prompt_similar_essays_issues.csv`
*   **Description:** This report likely flags two potential issues:
    1.  Essays that are too similar to the provided `prompt`, suggesting the author may have copied the prompt text extensively instead of producing an original response.
    2.  Essays that are suspiciously similar to other essays written for the same prompt, which could indicate plagiarism or template usage.

#### d. Suspect Essay Scoring
*   **File:** `suspect_scoring_issues.csv`
*   **Description:** This category contains essays where the assigned `band` score may be inconsistent with the essay's qualitative features (e.g., length, complexity, style). For example, a very short or simple essay receiving a high score would be flagged.

### 3. Patterns & Observations

*   **Data Formatting:** The sample original data shows multiple empty newline rows between paragraphs within a single essay entry. This is likely a data parsing or entry artifact that adds noise to the text and could affect length-based or NLP-based analysis.
*   **Gibberish Indicators:** The metrics for the sample gibberish essay are highly indicative. The `type_token_ratio` of `0.038` is extremely low, highlighting the repetitive nature of the text. This confirms that the chosen metrics are effective for identifying this type of noise.
*   **Comprehensive Issue Coverage:** The existence of four distinct issue reports demonstrates a thorough, multi-faceted approach to data cleaning, covering content quality, originality, and label correctness.

### 4. Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following next steps are recommended:

1.  **Systematic Review:** Manually review a sample from each issue CSV file to validate the automated checks. This is crucial for confirming the accuracy of the flagging rules before taking action.
2.  **Develop a Cleaning Strategy:**
    *   **Gibberish & Duplicates:** Confirmed gibberish and duplicate essays should be removed from the dataset to prevent the model from learning from irrelevant or misleading data.
    *   **Scoring & Similarity Issues:** Essays flagged for suspect scoring or high prompt similarity require more nuanced review. Consider having them re-evaluated by human scorers.
3.  **Pre-processing Implementation:** Add a pre-processing step to normalize the `essay` text. This should include, at a minimum, collapsing consecutive newlines into a single one to clean up the formatting observed in the sample data.
4.  **Documentation:** Document the findings and the cleaning decisions made. This ensures transparency and reproducibility for future work with the dataset.
